Prequelous - SQL is enough (A little revisited code and capabilities)
==================================================================

There are a lot of database libraries out there. Most of them try to create a new abstraction on top of SQL. I think SQL is already a quite nice abstraction for working with data. Prequel aims to make working with this abstraction a bit more comfortable, nothing more.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vannicaruso/prequel.png)](http://travis-ci.org/vannicaruso/prequel)

### Background

Prequelous is a small set of classes making handling of SQL queries in Scala a bit easier. It takes care of connection handling/pooling, sql escaping, parameter conversion and to some extent transaction handling.

Prequel was written by  [Johan Persson](https://github.com/jpersson) since he was not really happy with what he could find in terms of jdbc based database libraries. The library is heavily inspired by projects like [Querulous](https://github.com/nkallen/querulous), [Simplifying JDBC](http://scala.sygneca.com/code/simplifying-jdbc) and unreleased work of [Tristan Juricek](https://github.com/tristanjuricek).

See example below how prequelous can make your life easier.

### Database Compatibility

Prequelous should be compatible with most JDBC supported databases. He has only tested it using HSQLDB and PostgreSQL but MySQL and others should work fine. I [Giovanni Caruso](https://github.com/vannicaruso) tested it with oracle 11g v. 11.2.0.2 too.

### Use at your own risk

Although I'm using this library in my own projects I have not tested it with massive amounts of data so use at your own risk :-)

### Logging

Logging is enabled via slf4j api.

Now you can configure its behaviour through a configuration file.

Prequelous searches for a file named prequelous.properties in the classpath of the application.

This is an example:

    # will log Reader object's content for PreparedStatement and ResultSet if this parameter set to 'true' value. default is true
    prequelous.text=true
    # will show elapsed time. default is true
    prequelous.time=true
    # will print executable or not SQL (default true)
    prequelous.executable-log-format=true
    # will print the row returned by a statement
    prequelous.row-print=true

It can, now, log executable sql, such this:

    2013-10-26 22:06:02,740 [main] INFO  SQLLOG - insert into float_table values(1.500000, null); - { time: 32 ms }

or this:

    2013-10-27 02:07:46,207 [main] INFO  SQLLOG - Cursor read for sql {select c1, c2 from float_table;} -->  {c1: 1.5, c2: null}

### TODO

 * External file configuration


### Not supported

 * Any config files for database configuration
 * Any type of ORM voodoo (and will never be)

Examples
--------

Given the following import and definitions

```scala
import net.noerd.prequel.DatabaseConfig
import net.noerd.prequel.SQLFormatterImplicits._
import net.noerd.prequel.ResultSetRowImplicits._

case class Bicycle( id: Long, brand: String, releaseDate: DateTime )

val database = DatabaseConfig(
    driver = "org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver",
    jdbcURL = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:mymemdb"
)
```

Prequelous makes it quite comfortable for you to do:

## Inserts

```scala
def insertBicycle( bike: Bicycle ): Unit = {
    database.transaction { tx => 
        tx.execute( 
            "insert into bicycles( id, brand, release_date ) values( ?, ?, ? )", 
            bike.id, bike.brand, bike.releaseDate
        )
    }
}
```
## Batch Updates and Inserts

```scala
def insertBicycles( bikes: Seq[ Bicycle ] ): Unit = {
    database.transaction { tx => 
      tx.executeBatch( "insert into bicycles( id, brand, release_date ) values( ?, ?, ? )" ) { statement => 
        bikes.foreach { bike =>
          statment.executeWith( bike.id, bike.brand, bike.releaseDate )
        }
      }
    }
}
```
 
## Easily create objects from selects

```scala
def fetchBicycles(): Seq[ Bicycles ] = {
    database.transaction { tx => 
        Database(tx.connection).select( "select id, brand, release_date from bicycles" ) { r =>
            Bicycle( r, r, r )
        }
    }
}
```

## Select native types directly

```scala
def fetchBicycleCount: Long = {
    database.transaction { tx => 
        Database(tx.connection).selectLong( "select count(*) from bicycles")
    }
}
```

## Use an external Connection

```scala
val conn = ...
Database(conn).select( "select id, brand, release_date from bicycles" ) { r =>
  Bicycle( r, r, r )
}
```

## Use a jndi Connection from some DataSource

```scala
Database("jdbc/[Something]").select( "select id, brand, release_date from bicycles" ) { r =>
  Bicycle( r, r, r )
}
```

Use in your Project
-------------------

In the section [releases](https://github.com/vannicaruso/prequel/releases) you can download a fat jar containing this project plus all the classes needed by prequelous itself.


Dependencies
------------

### 3rd Party libs

I've tried to keep the list of dependencies as short as possible but currently the following
libraries are being used.

* [hikariCP 1.3.8](http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/) for faster datasource operations
* [commons-lang 2.6](http://commons.apache.org/lang) for SQL escaping
* [joda-time 2.2](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) for sane support of Date and Time
* [joda-convert 1.3.1](http://www.joda.org/joda-convert/) to aid conversion between Objects and Strings

### Testing

For testing I use [scala-test](http://www.scalatest.org) for unit-tests and [hsqldb](http://hsqldb.org) for in process db interaction during tests.
